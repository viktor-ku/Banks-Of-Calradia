# Banks of Calradia

I have to introduce an independent system that works
without the player and then introduce the player to this
system.

First of all, let's start simple, all towns should be able 
to borrow money in case they need it.

### Towns borrow money

When Money goes below a certain threshold it should borrow 
money.

Let's say when a Town has less than 10k denars it will want to 
borrow some money to survive.

### Towns have to give money back to Banks

Alright, now that Towns can borrow money, they also should pay back.
Banks are no charity after all.

- First of all, I have to remeber which town borrowed money
